    "The aim of this project is to build a 3D estimator for a quadcopter using Extended Kalman Filter(EKF). The estimator build in this project uses the following sensors IMU Sensors( Accelerometers and Gyroscope), Gps, Magnetometer. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Estimation-CPP) provide already contains the estimator implement partially and in this project the functions inside the estimator are built. This writeup disuss how each point in the project [rubic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1807/view) are satisfied.\n",

    "For a kalman filter it is important to model the measurement noise matrix usually this is provided by the sensor manufacturer. In this task the drone is kept stationary in a known position and the measurements are taken using the GPS and IMU sensors to find their standard deviations. The simulation data is logged into txt files(\\logs\\Graph1.txt and \\logs\\Graph2.txt). These files are imported in a python program and their mean and standard devation are calculated using the numpy functions np.mean() and np.std(). The calculated standard devation are entered in the configuration file for this scenario. The simulator reads these values and checks if the sensor measurements lie within this range for at least ~68% of the time which is the probablity for the range $\\mu\\pm\\sigma$ in the normal distribution. The calculated standard deviation passed this test scenario. The following picture shows the result\n",

    "\n",
    "The starter code of the project already contains the implementation of the complimentry filter which estimates the drone's pitch, roll, and yaw angles based on the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. But this implentation performs estimates the new drone attitude performing integration using the angular velocities from gyroscopic measurements directly. The gyroscopic measurements are in the body frame whereas the drone's attitude is in inertial frame and so this estimation works only for small angles of $\\phi,\\theta$. The task for this step is to improve the accurarcy of the roll and pitch angle estimation by converting the angular velocites from the gyro to inertial frame before performing the integration. This is done using the existing quaternion class. The quaternion class has a function called \"FromEuler123_RPY($\\phi,\\theta,\\psi$)\" which takes the current drone's attitude and converts it into a quaternion object. The Quaternion class also has a function \"IntegrateBodyRate(gyro, dt)\" which perform integration when gyro measurement and sample time are given. This function performs integration using quaternion instead of Roll,Pitch and Yaw angles. Finally the Quaternion class has functions \"Pitch()\",\"Roll()\",\"Yaw()\" to return the updated roll,pitch and yaw angles. \n",

    "The test scenario measures the error of the attitutde estimation and checks if it meets the required accuracy. This implementation acheives the required result and it is shown in the following picture.\n",

    "## Step-3-Prediction-Step ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction step of the Extendend Kalman Filter contains the following steps.\n",
    " - Calculation of the new state for a given control input, current state and sample time. This is done using the state transition function $g(x_t, u_t, \\Delta t)$.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Since the state transition function is non-linear it has to be differentiated to linearize the state transition function for each prediction step. This is done by calculating Jacobian matrix, which is the partical derivative of state vector of size(n) by each state variable yeilding the linear state transition matrix $g'(x_t, u_t, \\Delta t)$ of size(n,n)\n",
    " \n",
    " - Then the linear state transition matrix is used to update the process covariance matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the state transition function and jacobian matrix is given in the [Estimation for Quadrotors](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vymfngphcccj#/54894644/) document. This is implemented in the project in the following functions.\n",

    "- VectorXf QuadEstimatorEKF::PredictState(VectorXf curState, float dt, V3F accel, V3F gyro), this function updates the ekf state vector. \n",
    "- MatrixXf QuadEstimatorEKF::GetRbgPrime(float roll, float pitch, float yaw), this function calculates the partial derivative of rotation matrix with respect to Yaw angle. This is require to  calculate the linearized state transition matrix. This is requrired because the acceration measurements from the IMU are used are control inputs which are measured in body frame.\n",

From this scenario it can be seen the that the IMU sensor is able to track changes in the position and velocity of the drone but it has sensor drift because accumulating the noise because of integration. This can be seen in the following picture.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After the prediction step the update step has to be implemented. In this estimator the update step is straight forward because the IMU sensors measurement is not used in the update step which makes the update step linear. The magnetometer measures the heading of the drone by measuring the earth's magnetic field. In the update step the measurement transition function is calculated which converts the current state vector into measurement vector. In case of magnetometer the yaw angle is calulated directly it measurement transition function is vector given by $h' = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]$. Multiplying this matrix to the state vector extract the yaw angle in the state which is the measurement of the magnetometer. \n",

    "This is implemented in the void QuadEstimatorEKF::UpdateFromMag(float magYaw) funciton. This function specifies the $h'$ matrix, calculates the yaw angle from the current state. Then it calls the function Update(z,h',R_Mag,zFromX) where the generic update equations of the kalman filter are implemented. The Update function calculates the new state and new covariance matrix after update step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yaw angle from the current state has to be normalized to keep it in the range $-\\pi to \\pi$ before prediction step is performed. This is done by monitoring the difference between the measured yaw rate and the yaw rate of the state. The simulator has a test scenario for the yaw angle estimation.\n",
